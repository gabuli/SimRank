# A simple implementation of SimRank

This is a Data Science project which I developed for a university course. 
It consists of a simple Python implementation of the SimRank algorithm, which can be used for community detection of social networks.

This project aims at delving deeper into network analytics as well as Python programming. For the latter objective, this implementation
intentionally features low-level Python code, therefore dependency on other modules is kept as limited as possible. 
It would certainly be wiser to use optimized packages such as `networkX` or `igraph`. That being said, however, this project
could be a useful resource to both revise Python programming and - hopefully - to showcase some of my Data Science skills.
